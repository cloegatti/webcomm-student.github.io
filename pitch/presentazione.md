# The Idea
Creating a personal website for a friend who is a photographer, showcasing: <br>
- Portfolio and galleries <br>
- About section <br>
- Contact information <br>
- A clean, modern visual identity

---

# How It Started
I began by choosing a **W3Schools W3.CSS template** as a base layout. <br>

Steps: <br>
- Tested the template using the W3Schools online editor <br>
- Modified structure, content and layout directly in the browser <br>
- Later decided to move the entire project to **Visual Studio Code** <br>
- Started organizing files, assets and libraries properly <br>

# Moving to VS Code
Why switch to VS Code? <br>
- Better file structure control <br>
- Easier CSS and JavaScript management <br>
- Ability to use extensions (Live Server) <br>
- Local image and asset preview, while W3Schools free version had limit on numbers of pictures I could upload.

# Template Customization
Once imported into VS Code, I started customizing the template: <br>
- Modified **classes and layout** from the original W3.CSS structure <br>
- Added personalized color palette and typography <br>
- Reorganized the **gallery** to better match the photographer’s style <br>
- Implemented responsive adjustments

---

# CSS Personalization
I wrote custom CSS rules to override the default W3.CSS, which was basically already set through a live server precompiled sheet to my own style.

# JavaScript Additions

I added lightweight JavaScript functions to improve usability:

- Modal image viewer
- Smooth scroll for navigation
- Button back to the top
- About me section effect

# Future of the Website

The website will be implemented in future adding new pictures as soon as the photographer takes new one.
It would be nice to add more pages looking deeply in any style he works on.

# What I Learned

Thanks to Web Communication lecture, I did something I never expected I could have done. 
With almost no experience in coding, and no knowledge about CSS and Javascript functions, it was tough to work many hours on the project but very satysfying seeing it being constructed day after day. 
I learned what is behind website programming and can now understand the language and deal with it in case of inconveniences while working.
